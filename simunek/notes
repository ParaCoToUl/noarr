Mother of all requiremets
https://github.com/krulis-martin/cuda-kmeans

Main ideas:
1) Parts: CPU logic/policies/GPU logic
2) Create library for policies
3) Rewrite cuda-kmeans using new framework, to gain following:
  a) Hopefully simpler and shorter code of k-means
  b) Natural support of diffener data layouts (easy swaps)
  c) Similar or higher level of performance
4) Get somehow at last mark 3 after we fail to achieve anything.
5) Run.


Functional requiremets
- Support for C++, bindings to Python, R
- Predefined basic data layouts for quick ot of the box usage.
