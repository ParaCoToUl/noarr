# Data orchestration

## Chunks

a chunk is a *bag*

## Data streams

- every stream is split in multiple (up to infinity) *chunks*.
- they are generated by *loaders*

### Orchestreamor

- sees all streams and reallocates (or recycles) chunks

### Vertices

- **map vertex** (takes k input streams and outputs l output streams)
  - the inner "lambda" kernel arguments reflect the input and output streams in some predefined form
    - output streams defined by loaders
  - there should be a way of defining more arguments dependent on the situation
- **reduce vertex** collects a stream and outputs a stream(??)
- **loader vertex** (a 0-1 map?)
  - has only one output stream and no input streams

## Loaders

- `structure_wrapper.chunk_by<'x', 'y'>()` creates a stream of grid *chunks* as if generated by nested for loops over 'x' and 'y'.
