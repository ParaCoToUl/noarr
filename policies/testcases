[H1] Triangle
Arrays of legth 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...
PROBLEM [IN CUBIFICATION]: Space wasted is O(N). 

[H1] Heap 
Arrays of length 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64...
PROBLEM [IN CUBIFICATION]: Space wasted is O(N^2).

[H1] Any 
Arrays of length any legth, where max legth is N and legth of array of arrays is M
PROBLEM [IN CUBIFICATION]: Space wasted is O(N*M).
